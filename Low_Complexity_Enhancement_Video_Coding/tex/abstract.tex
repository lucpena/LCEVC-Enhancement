\acrfull{LCEVC} operates as an enhancement layer over conventional video encoders, 
such as \acrfull{AVC} and \acrfull{VVC}, focusing on efficiency and low computational 
complexity. This work presents a quality analysis of the \acrshort{LCEVC} standard, 
aiming to identify the most favorable scenarios where \acrshort{LCEVC} can surpass the 
quality or bitrate of videos encoded solely with the base codecs it enhances. The study 
also seeks to discover the best parameter configurations for an efficient \acrshort{LCEVC} usage. Experiments 
were conducted by varying the quantization parameters of the base layer (\acrshort{QP}) 
and the enhancement layer (\textit{SW2}), using metrics such as \acrfull{PSNR} and bitrate. 
The results, analyzed through the Pareto Frontier, indicate that \acrshort{LCEVC} performs 
better in several scenarios, especially for \textit{Full HD} and 4K resolution videos. 
Moreover, specific \acrshort{QP} and \textit{SW2} combinations were found to yield more 
efficient encodings, contributing to optimal usage configurations of \acrshort{LCEVC} for 
high-quality video applications with lower computational costs.
