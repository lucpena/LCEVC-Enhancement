This work presents a qualitative analysis of the Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding 
(\acrfull{LCEVC}) standard, standardized by the \acrfull{MPEG} and developed by V-Nova. 
\acrshort{LCEVC} operates as an enhancement layer over existing codecs, providing quality 
improvements with low computational complexity. Tests were conducted with different 
quantization values for the base layer (\acrfull{AVC} and \acrfull{VVC}) and for the 
enhancement parameters of \acrshort{LCEVC}. The obtained results, analyzed comparing
\acrfull{PSNR} and bitrate values, indicate that \acrshort{LCEVC} can offer superior 
performance in certain scenarios, especially when compared to the isolated use of 
conventional codecs. The tests were implemented through automated scripts in Linux 
environments. This study highlights the potential of \acrshort{LCEVC} as an efficient 
solution for high-quality video transmission with low computational cost.
